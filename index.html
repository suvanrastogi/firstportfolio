              I am a passionate tech geek and an aspiring developer, currently
              exploring different areas of technology, programming languages,
              and frameworks. I have a genuine interest in
              problem-solving—whether it’s brainstorming solutions, identifying
              edge cases, or thinking through exceptions. I believe that a
              solution is never truly complete unless it is scalable, efficient,
              optimized, and built with a future-ready mindset.
              <br />
              <br />
              Although I’m just starting my journey, I’m constantly learning new
              things and improving myself step by step. I enjoy experimenting,
              breaking things, fixing them again, and understanding how real
              systems work behind the scenes.
              <br /><br />
              Outside the tech world, I’m an astrophile who loves learning about
              the universe, and I also enjoy reading books in my free time.
